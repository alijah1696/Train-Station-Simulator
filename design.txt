In the config class there is a map of passengers to its respective lock and condition
The config file also holds all the locations and information about the train and passengers.
It has many helper functions that return booleans about the simulation state (handles much of the logic)

The passenger thread class simply waits until they are signalled then decides to move or not

The trainthread class operates in two syncrhonized steps:
    1. It alerts and wakes up all the passnegers at the current station and currently
       onboard the train giving them access back to there lock. Once the passsengers board or deboard 
       they go back to await for there lock to be signalled.
    2. If the next station is free it moves to it. If the train moves there will be a 5 ms delay
       so that other trains can have the ability to move.
